Description: virt-back: A backup utility for QEMU, KVM, XEN, and Virtualb
 A backup utility for QEMU, KVM, XEN, and Virtualbox guests.
 Virt-back is a python application that uses the libvirt api to safely 
 shutdown, gzip, and restart guests.  The backup process logs to syslog
 for auditing and virt-back works great with cron for scheduling outages.
