.SH SYNOPSIS
.B virt-back
[\fI\,options\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
A backup utility for QEMU, KVM, XEN, and Virtualbox guests. Virt\-back is a
python application that uses the libvirt api to safely  shutdown, gzip, and
restart guests.  The backup process logs to syslog for auditing and virt\-back
works great with cron for scheduling outages. Virt\-back has been placed in the
public domain and  the latest version may be downloaded here:
